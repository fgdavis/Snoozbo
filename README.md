# Snoozbo

Snoozbo is an app that is supposed help people break out of their bad snoozing habits. It is supposed to do this by deactivating 
the snooze function if the user snoozes one too many times in a set time frame. Sadly we were unable to bring this idea into fruition 
as we ran into a snag where the snooze button would not appear. This is a major error for this app as pressing the snooze button is when 
the users records and checks his/her data.
